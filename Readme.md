## Yandex Downloader

Some programs download yandex disk completely but make it zip file at first. But disk size so big 
and if your connection interrupt when download file, you will loose all files with corrupted zip file. And you can not continue because yandex server doesn't allow control byte range when download. 
This command line tool help you download file by file. If some problem occured, you can start
it again and again, this program doesnt download some file again. I hope it helps you.

# Example:
`chmod +x yandex-downloader.py`

`./yandex-downloader.py`
